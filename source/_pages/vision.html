		<h2 class="headline io-headline">Our Purpose</h2>
		<p class="text-white io-copy">Every member of AVAVA’s team has built their career around innovative problem solving: identifying a need, imagining a solution and bringing it to life. As pioneers in medical technologies, we look for real-world health and wellness issues that lack safe and globally effective treatments. We seek groups of patients who fall through the cracks: those who struggle with treatable concerns, but cannot find a solution due to gaps in technological advances. Our past endeavors have included laser hair removal, fractional skin resurfacing and cryolipolysis (CoolSculpting).<br><br>

		With AVAVA, we started with common problems facing the field of dermatology today: hyperpigmentation and melasma, particularly among dark-skinned individuals. These skin issues are effectively treated for patients with lighter skin using standard laser therapies, but currently available laser technologies are too imprecise and too dependent on surface-level contrast to offer effective results for those with darker skin. We envisioned a skincare landscape in which widely available laser treatments can provide a solution for patients of all skin tones and types.</p>

		<h2 class="headline io-headline">Our Mission</h2>
		<p class="text-white io-copy">We set out to create the technology missing from the laser skin therapy market. We knew there would be a demand for laser therapy effective on dark skin: hyperpigmentation and melasma prevent millions of individuals worldwide from having healthy, even-toned skin, yet only a small percentage of these patients have the option of effectively treating their concerns. A majority of the world’s population has dark-toned skin, with a prevalence of hyperpigmentation concerns in over half of African-American, Hispanic and Asian individuals.<br></br>

		With our team’s combined expertise in medicine, technology and business, we succeeded in developing AVAVA, a revolutionary approach to laser treatment for hyperpigmentation and melasma. Our laser uses novel three-dimensional spatial selectivity to target hyperpigmentation below the surface, enabling effective treatment for patients of color while providing unprecedented precision, customizability and safety. And, though our core mission focuses on skin therapy, our new laser technology will be broadly applicable across multiple medical and scientific fields.</p>

		<h2 class="headline io-headline">Our Values</h2>
		<p class="text-white io-copy">We believe in uncompromising excellence. When we set out to find a solution to a problem, we do not sacrifice one aspect of our vision for another. We are driven to achieve meaningful clinical therapies that are safe, tolerable and globally effective; we consider anything less to be unsuccessful. With AVAVA, we have proudly created a technology that not only achieves our goal of providing a solution for hyperpigmentation and melasma in all skin types, but that also sets the highest bar yet for patient safety.<br><br>

		People and patients are at the heart of our motivations. Our curiosity and creativity are driven by real problems experienced by our patients and others worldwide. Above all else, we set out with a tenacious spirit to make a difference in the lives of patients who struggle with health and wellness concerns, and in the lives of the providers who struggle to find safe and effective treatments for their patients’ needs.</p>

		<h2 class="headline io-headline">Our Goals</h2>
		<p class="text-white io-copy">We see great potential in AVAVA, and our goals include both immediate uses for our technology as well as broad possibilities for other clinical applications. We first aim to bring our laser therapy platform to life as a precision treatment system that addresses pressing skin problems for patients with darker skin tones. We especially intend to offer AVAVA as a solution for hyperpigmentation, melasma and acne scarring. Our pilot clinical studies have shown great success, with unprecedented pigment reduction in just one week after treatment.<br><br>

		As we continue to develop the AVAVA system, we are poised to share our technological breakthroughs with the medical and scientific community as a whole. We look forward to expanding the use of AVAVA’s customizable, 3D precision capabilities into areas beyond laser therapy for hyperpigmentation. Potential broader impacts include other dermatological applications, cosmetic body sculpting uses, surgical opportunities and more. We intend to make our technology widely available as part of our mission to improve patient care across multiple fields, and we are excited to see the directions our laser technology will go in the future.</p>
